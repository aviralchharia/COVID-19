# COVID-19 Detection Project

AI is already transforming many different fields. One such field is the area of Medical Diagnosis through accurate clinical computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. I applied a CNN Model, which I had trained on a COVID-19 Radiography dataset containing Chest X-Rays, for detecting COVID-19 & achieved ~98% accuracy on the validation set with respective to Radiologist's clinical findings.

Further working on high accuracy multi-class classification of X-Rays for computer-aided diagnosis system which also finds the area of lungs affected by COVID-19.
